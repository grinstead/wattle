# wattle
An engine for in-browser game-jam games.

I like learning how things work, so I'm developing game-jam games without using a prior engine, and instead building up a set of tools from the ground up.

The name wattle comes from an old [construction technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_(construction)) where buildings would be made of a base framework of sticks (wattle) and then covered in mud (daub). This engine is the flimsy framework for your handmade constructions :)
